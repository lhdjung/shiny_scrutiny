This repo contains the source code of a Shiny app for the R package [scrutiny](https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/). The app is under development. It's not yet functional.

The goal of the app is to provide an intuitive web interface that brings the powers of scrutiny to the broader scientific public:

-   Consistency testing with GRIM, GRIMMER, etc.

-   Duplicate detection

-   (More scrutiny features?)
