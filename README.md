This repo contains the source code of the [**scrutiny webapp**](https://lukasjung.shinyapps.io/shiny_scrutiny/). It's a Shiny app that leverages the R package [scrutiny](https://lhdjung.github.io/scrutiny/) for error detection in science.

The app provides an intuitive web interface that brings the powers of scrutiny and other software to the broader scientific public:

-   Consistency testing with GRIM, GRIMMER, etc.

-   Duplicate detection

-   ACF plot using the [forecast](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/index.html) package
